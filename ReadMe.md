# 3D Plantigrade Feet

This repository contains and STL file to 3D print a plantigrade foot with serial segments. 

This serves as a demo to complement the talk "Plantigrade feet can avoid work through serial linkages", presented at SEB 2023. A prerecorded version of the talk can be found [here](https://youtu.be/BIwkG6a5WEo)

The joints are based on the 3D hinges designed by Angus Deveson (MakersMuse on YouTube) as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JhjhgjchfM), and available [here](https://gumroad.com/products/HFUjr).
