# 3D Plantigrade Feet

This repository contains STL files to 3D print plantigrade feet. 

This serves as a demo to complement the talk "Plantigrade feet can avoid work through serial linkages", presented at SEB 2023.

The joints are based on the 3D hinges designed by Angus Deveson (MakersMuse on YouTube) as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JhjhgjchfM), and available [here](https://gumroad.com/products/HFUjr).
